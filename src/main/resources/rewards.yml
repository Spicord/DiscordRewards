# If you are using BungeeCord and you want to execute commands in different servers
# you need to add the server name between "[]" before the command, you can get the
# server name in your BungeeCord's config.yml file, in the "servers" section!
# Example:
# - '[lobby] tell {player_name} Hey! you have a pending reward in the survival server!'
# - '[survival] tell {player_name} You got $500 for verifying your account!'
# - '[survival] eco give {player_name} 500'

###===---
# When a (discord) user reach a certain message amount it can be rewarded.
# Don't forget that the user needs to have verified/linked their account!

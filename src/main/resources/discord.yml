# This adds a role to the user when it verifies their account.
# The "type" is the method the bot will use to get the role
# and add it to the user, the type can be 'name' or 'id'.
# When using 'name' you should put the EXACT role name in the
# 'role' option, it will be created if it don't exists.
# If you use 'name', you should update this config if you
# rename the role.
# But if you use 'id' you don't need to care about renaming
# the role because the role id will always be the same.

# Do you want to rename the Discord user to a custom name?
# If this is enabled, make sure that the users don't
# have permission to change their names.

# If 'rename-user' is true, what name should the user have?
# The default option will rename the discord user to the same
# name as it have on your minecraft server.
# You can add a prefix or suffix but in my opinion
# that looks really bad.
# An example with prefix/suffix will be like:
# new-name: '[User] {player_name}'

rename-user: true
new-name: '{player_name}'

# If this is enabled, a message will be sent to a channel of
# your choice when an user completes the verification process.
# The message is located at 'embed/complete.json', feel free
